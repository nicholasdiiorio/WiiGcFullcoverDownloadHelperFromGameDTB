# WiiGcFullcoverDownloadHelperFromGameDTB

This is a small tool to download Wii And GameCube fullcover for USBLoaderGX.

For the folder: disc, cover3d and cover a zip can already be downloaded from https://www.gametdb.com/Wii/Downloads.

But for some reason we cannont get a zip for the full cover so I made this tool.

To use this tool you must download the wiitdb.txt on the gametdb.com website, here's the link: https://www.gametdb.com/wiitdb.txt?LANG=EN

PS: This tool was made for the US-EN fullcovers but the source code is here if you need to modify it yourself.
PSS: This tool is only for Windows.
